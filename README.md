<br/>


I am a statistician interested in Bayesian Statistics and AI.  

I received a Bachelor's degree in Applied Statistics and a Bachelor's degree in Software Humanities at Chung-Ang University on February, 2022.  
I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics at Chung-Ang University with full scholarship from Chung-Ang University GRS(Graduate Research Scholarship).  

I was a member of Chung-Ang University GAS(Global Ambassador Scholarship - 중앙대학교 국제처 학생대사) from July 2020 to June 2021.  
I was a member of CUAI(Chung-Ang University Artificial Intelligence - 중앙대학교 인공지능 학회) from March 2021 to February 2022.  

I am proficient in Python and R.

## Personal Projects

Projects I have done out of my own interest or for participations in competitions.


#### • r/depression Text Anaylsis

[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/jaeyonggy/Project-RedditDepressionTextAnalysis/blob/main/depression_text_analysis.ipynb)  
I performed a text analysis with posts from a subreddit called r/depression.  
Check out [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jaeyonggy/Project-RedditDepressionTextAnalysis) for more information.  
<br/>


#### • bloods.ai Blood Spectroscopy Classification Challenge

[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/jaeyonggy/Zindi_Classification/blob/main/pca_rf_xgb_cv_final.ipynb)  
I participated in a competition called Blood Spectroscopy Classification Challenge hosted by zindi.africa. It was a mutliclass classification problem and preventing overfitting was of the utmost importance.

The projects I have done as a member of the 4th season(2021) of CUAI(Chung-Ang Univ. Artifical Intelligence).


#### • Album Recommendation System Based On Image Similarity - 이미지 유사도 기반 앨범 추천 시스템

[Paper](https://github.com/CUAI-CAU/2021-CUAI-Winter-Conference/blob/main/paper/J.pdf)  
[Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff_UeduK5lk)  
[Poster](https://github.com/CUAI-CAU/2021-CUAI-Winter-Conference/blob/main/poster/J.pdf)  
Our team has managed to implement a music recommendation system based on image similarity. The system gets a user's preferred album's album cover and the album's emotions(one of angry, happy, relaxed and sad) as inputs. By YOLO and k-means models, we output 5 albums that is pre-classified as the same emotion as the input's whose album covers are the most similar to the input's album cover.

#### • Predicting change in stock price using news' headlines - 뉴스 기사 제목을 활용한 주가 변동여부 예측

[Prediction model - Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/jaeyonggy/CUAI-Headlines_TextAnalysis_For_StockPrice_Prediction/blob/main/tfidf_title_to_pred.ipynb)  
[Scraping headlines - Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/jaeyonggy/CUAI-Headlines_TextAnalysis_For_StockPrice_Prediction/blob/main/Web%20Scraping%20for%20headlines/data_title.ipynb)  
[Scraping stock price data - Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/jaeyonggy/CUAI-Headlines_TextAnalysis_For_StockPrice_Prediction/blob/main/Web%20Scraping%20for%20headlines/data_stock.ipynb)  
[Merging data - Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/jaeyonggy/CUAI-Headlines_TextAnalysis_For_StockPrice_Prediction/blob/main/Web%20Scraping%20for%20headlines/data_merge.ipynb)   
Our team wanted to predict whether or not a stock's price increases based on an article's headline. We utilized webscraping to get various headlines of some specific stocks and their stock price at the end of a market the day after the headline was written. We implemented a classification model to predict and assessed its performance.
